    This project demos HTML5 Canvas 2D and clipping objects with other objects. In this case,
    it's clipping other scene elements with an emulation of the player's view-field cone. You can 
    rotate your vision with the left/right keys, and move in the direction you're facing with the up
    key, or move in the opposite direction with the down key.
