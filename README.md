# Periphery.js
Central vision field, plus peripheral vision proof of concept in HTML5 and a 2D canvas.

[Check out the demo here](http://cfurrow.github.com/periphery.js/)

Right now it only clips objects that intersect with the "central" vision
field. The end-goal would be to clip objects in the periphery vision
area as well, but blur/darken them a bit to emulate periphery vision.
